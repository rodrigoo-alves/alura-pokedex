** Search Your Favorite Pokémon with Ease! - Imersao Dev com Google Gemini **

This JavaScript application brings the thrill of the Pokémon world right to your fingertips! Want to quickly find information about a specific Pokémon? Look no further!

**What It Does**

- **Intuitive Search:** Simply type a Pokémon's name into the input field and hit the search button.
- **Instant Results:** The application dynamically displays the Pokémon's image, name, type, ability, and hidden ability in a user-friendly card format.
- **Error Handling:** If you enter an invalid Pokémon name (or leave the field blank), the application gracefully provides a "Pokemon not found" message with a missing Pokémon image.

**Under the Hood**

- **JavaScript:** This application is powered by JavaScript, a versatile language that brings interactivity to web pages.
- **DOM Manipulation:** It leverages the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements, like selecting the search input, button, and the card section where results are displayed.
- **Event Listeners:** Event listeners are used to detect user actions, such as clicking the search button, and trigger the search functionality.
- **Conditional Logic:** The code employs conditional statements (`if`, `else`) to display either the search results or the "Pokemon not found" message based on the search outcome.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-search-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-search-app.git)
   ```
2. **Open the HTML File:**
   Locate the `index.html` file in your code editor.
3. **Run the Application:**
   - **Local Server:** Open `index.html` in a web browser using a local server like `http-server` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
   - **Directly in Browser:** If supported by your browser (consider security implications), you might be able to open `index.html` directly.

**Customization (Optional)**

- You can modify the HTML and CSS files to customize the application's appearance (colors, fonts, etc.).
